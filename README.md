Kontrol - a micro framework
===========================

Kontrol is a small web framework written in Ruby, which runs directly
on [Rack][1]. Basically you can mount a class as rack handler and
attach a set of named routes, which will be used for route recognition
and generation.

All examples can be found in the examples folder of the kontrol
project, which is hosted on [github][2].

## Quick Start

We will create a simple Kontrol application with exactly one route
named 'root'. Routes are defined within a block insider your
application class. Each route has a name, a pattern and a block. The
name must be defined to generate paths pointing to this route.

`hello_world.ru`:

    class HelloWorld < Kontrol::Application
      
      def time
        Time.now.strftime "%H:%M:%S"
      end
     
      map do
        root '/' do
          text "<h1>Hello World at #{time}</h1>"
        end
      end
    end
        
    run HelloWorld.new
    
Now run:

    rackup hello_world.ru

Browse to `http://localhost:9292` and you will see "Hello World".


## Basics

A Kontrol application is a class, which provides some context to the
defined actions. You will probably use these methods:

- __request__: the Rack request object
- __response__: the Rack response object
- __params__: union of GET and POST parameters
- __cookies__: shortcut to request.cookies
- __session__: shortcut to `request.env['rack.session']`
- __redirect(path)__: renders a redirect response to specified path
- __render(file, variables)__: render a template with specified variables
- __text(string)__: render a string


## Routing

Routing is just as simple as using regular expressions with
groups. Each group will be provided as argument to the block.

Create a file named `routing.ru`:

    require 'kontrol'
    
    class Routing < Kontrol::Application
      map do
        pages '/pages/(.*)' do |name|
          text "The path is #{ pages_path name }! "
        end
     
        archive '/(\d*)/(\d*)' do |year, month|
          text "The path is #{ archive_path year, month }! "
        end
      end
    end
    
    run Routing.new
    
Now run this application:

    rackup routing.ru

You will now see, how regex groups and parameters are related. For
example if you browse to `localhost:9292/2008/12`, the app will
display `The path is /2008/12`.

The inverse operation to route recognition is route generation. That
means a route with one or more groups can generate a url, which will
be recognized this very route.

For example the route `/page/(.*)` named page will recognize the path
`/page/about`, which can be generated by using `page_path('about')`.


## Templates

Rendering templates is as simple as calling a template file with some
parameters, which are accessible inside the template as instance
variables. Additionally you will need a layout template.

Create a template named `templates/layout.rhtml`:

    <html>
      <body>
        <%= @content %>
      </body>
    </html>

And now another template named `templates/page.rhtml`:

    <h1><%= @title %></h1>
    <%= @body %>

Create a templates.ru file:

    require 'kontrol'
    
    class Templates < Kontrol::Application
      map do
        page '/(.*)' do |name|
          render "page.rhtml", :title => name.capitalize, :body => "This is the body!"
        end
      end
    end
    
    run Templates.new

Now run this example:

    rackup templates.ru

If you browse to any path on `localhost:9292`, you will see the
rendered template. Note that the title and body parameters have been
passed to the `render` call.


## Using GitStore

[GitStore][3] is another library, which allows you to store code and
data in a convenient way in a git repository. The repository is
checked out into memory and any data may be saved back into the
repository.

Install [GitStore][] by:

    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ sudo gem install georgi-git_store

We create a Markdown file name `index.md`:

    Hello World
    ===========

    This is the **Index** page!

We have now a simple page, which should be rendered as response. We
create a simple app in a file `git_app.ru`:

    class GitApp < Kontrol::Application
     
      def initialize(path)
        super
        @store = GitStore.new(path)
      end
      
      map do
        page '/(.*)' do |name|
          text BlueCloth.new(@store[name + '.md']).to_html
        end
      end
    end

Add all the page to your git repository:

    git init
    git add index.md
    git commit -m 'init'

Run the app:

    rackup git_app.ru

Browse to `http://localhost:9292/index` and you will see the rendered
page generated from the markdown file.

This application runs straight from the git repository. You can even
delete the page and it will still show up over the web.
